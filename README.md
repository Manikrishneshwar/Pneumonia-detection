This project aims to build a deep learning–based pipeline for detecting Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray images using multiple pretrained CNN architectures.


This project uses the widely-used Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset from Kaggle:

Kaggle Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

The dataset is sourced from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center and contains carefully labeled pediatric chest X-ray images.
